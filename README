# About
For some reason, there is no built in way in Mint Cinammon (or Ubuntu, Xubuntu to my knowledge), and probably other DE's, to have a keypress move a window to another monitor.

In Mint, there are keyboard shortcut options for moving to an _edge_, which can be used to to move non-maximized window to the left edge of the left-most monitor or right edge of the right-most monitor.

There are other scripts floating around, but I have not found one that works quite right with F11 fullscreen (as opposed to _maximized_) windows.  Also, this script should detect (horizontal) monitor sizes and left-right order for you.  It's designed to work with more than 2 (horizontally placed) monitors, though I don't have the means to test that myself.  In the case of three or more monitors, it will cycle the window around the monitors (i.e., you can't specify a direction, though that would be a simple modification to make).

# Install
To install, place the script in a desired location, make sure it's executable:

```bash
chmod +x switch-monitors.sh
```

Then edit Keyboard Settings > Keyboard Shortcuts and add a custom shortcutthat executes this script upon the desired keypressing. I use Ctrl+m.
